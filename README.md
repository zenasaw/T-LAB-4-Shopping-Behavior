Based on the analysis of this project, we see that most people didnt use the promo code and that there was an overwhelming number of younger shoppers and of whom mostly shopped in Winter season. By removing the extraneous data that provided no value and focusing on the shoppers, I was able to see that people who did have a promo card spent more money shopping and that each season purchases were made related to the day-to-day events happening like Fall people bought backpacks because it is the start of the school day,etc.

## Observations 


Going through this workflow was hardest during the end of each project, as it wasnt something we learned in the class. I believe that the links provided was a bit confusing because it was hard to decipher which code was meant for that code inquiry in the projects. I observed that there was an occassion for why people were shopping, making it more sensical that people are more likely to shop for leggings in the winter since it is not needed during a summer season. Also, recognizing that those who didnt use promo codes are of middle-age meanning they might have more money than a 20 year old or a 60 year old. Next actions I will take moving forward to learn more about this dataset is utilizing the income of these individuals compared to their purchase amount to provide me a better picture of the spending habits across all ages.
